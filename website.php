        <h2>Data Information</h2>
        <p>
            Data for the Mars' Weather website was gathered from NASA’s “InSight: Mars' Weather Service API.”
            The Insight Lander takes continuous weather measurements of the Martian atmosphere in Elysium Planitia,
            a large plain near Mars’ equator. The API provides daily changes in weather in Elysium Planitia
            and hourly changes of wind direction and wind sample count. Below are some metrics gathered based on the
            data collected from the API.

                    This is a wind rose, which contains information about the direction, frequency,
                    and strength of wind over the last three Sols. The area in each radial histogram bin indicates
                    the frequency of wind pointing in that direction, and the counts (indicated by the color) are a proxy
                    for the strength of the wind when it was blowing that direction.

                    This is the average temperature, pressure, and wind speed over the past few weeks. The
                    red line is our forecast. Samples are taken once per day.

            In this project, we wanted to inform clients and others of Mars' weather.
            We decided on this project because we wanted to explore more information on Mars and
            inform others in a simplified local form. We began by extracting and organizing data on
            Mars' weather measurements and compiling them into graphs that could be easily
            understood and interpreted. The data we are making use of is from NASA's MARS InSight Mission.
            We are also utilizing this data to forecast future Mars' weather, by a day or so.
